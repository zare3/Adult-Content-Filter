You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet! The web site works great on mobile.
By using Omegle, you accept the terms at the bottom. You must be 18+, or 13+ with parental permission.
Omegle (oh·meg·ull)
is a great way to meet new friends. When you
use Omegle, we pick someone else at random and let you talk one-on-one. To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not suggested!), and you can stop a chat at any time. Predators have been known to use Omegle, so please be careful.
If you prefer, you can add your interests, and Omegle will look for
someone who's into some of the same things as you instead of someone
completely random.
By using Omegle, you accept the terms at the bottom. You must be 18+ or 13+ with parental permission.

OMEGLE IS PROVIDED AS IS, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, NOT EVEN A WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. If you are interested in learning more about these protections, information is available at http://kids.getnetwise.org/tools/ as well as a number of other Internet sites that provide information on this form of protection.
* Omegle video chat is moderated. However, moderation is not perfect. You may still encounter people who misbehave. They are solely responsible for their own behavior.
