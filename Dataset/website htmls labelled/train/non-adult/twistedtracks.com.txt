Welcome to the Twistedtracks.com Royalty Free Music and Sound Effects Library!
Royalty Free Music and Sound Effects
Finding fresh sounding, professionally produced royalty free music and sound effects coupled with the ease and affordability of royalty-free licensing used to be an utterly impossible task. But no longer! Now you have Twistedtracks.com, a production music and sound design resource stocked with only the finest tracks and sounds from a creative collective of global musical talent.
When it comes to the talent that creates our library, what sets us apart is our attitude. Instead of hiring musicians to score a piece for a typical stock use, our roster is made up of artists who created their music first as art. Music that they are truly passionate about...as musicians, not businesspeople. That makes a music library forged by emotion, not formula.
Everyone from filmmakers and game developers to multimedia producers can benefit from our royalty free music and sound effects. And unlike needle-drop fees which require complicated per-use payments, once you've bought a license to a track or sound, it's yours to use as many times as you like, anywhere you'd like. And our license fees won't burn up your budget, either.
We offer our music and sound effects as individually downloadable 48k AIF, 44.1k MP3 and WAV files, and genre-based collections for download or delivery on CD or DVD-ROM. Tracks are available in full length, broadcast length edits, as well as stingers and loops. Register and/or login to get 'clean' previews of all tracks. You can even download the previews for free, to make sure they work prior to purchase.
Licensing Options
You can license our royalty free music and sound effects a number of ways...from a single track or sound to unlocking the entire site. Here's a quick synopsis:
