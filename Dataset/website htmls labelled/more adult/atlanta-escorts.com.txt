I hereby certify under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America (28 U.S.C. §1746) that I am currently 18 years of age or older (or the age of majority in the place from which I am accessing TER), and that I knowingly wish to access TER, which I know contains content of a sexually explicit nature.
The sexually explicit material I intend to view is for my own personal use.
