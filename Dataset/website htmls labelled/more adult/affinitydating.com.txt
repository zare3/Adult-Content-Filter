Looking for a lasting relationship with real affinity?
The matchaffinity.com dating service gives you a helping hand in finding just that: a genuine connection and natural rapport with someone you know is on the same wavelength as you. So, if you are hankering for that special closeness you experience with true affinity, youve come to the right place.
We understand how different people can be. Our matchmaking system therefore seeks to recognise our members core beliefs and characteristics to give a reliable idea of which like-minded members could be destined for a strong, lasting relationship.
Taking the affinity questionnaire
The matchaffinity.com dating service is all about successful matchmaking, so we need to learn about you before suggesting members you might bond with. Our free Affinity Questionnaire is designed to establish your interests, personality and overall outlook on life, as well as your individual views on important life issues like love, money and family.
How the matchmaking system works
matchaffinity.com uses the information you and our other members have given us to decipher the most compatible candidates for a successful, lasting relationship. Well show you your most compatible matches, and you will be able to see your affinity score with other matchaffinity.com members, plus a more in-depth breakdown of your relationship compatibility.
Making matchmaking simple
Our unique dating service aims to give you the best chance of finding a life partner. We provide online advice and coaching videos to inspire you on your dating journey. We will also give you tailored tips and advice on what characteristics your personality type should be looking out for in a potential dating partner.
Introducing yourself
The next step will be to fill in your profile and add a few photos, giving you the chance to introduce yourself to other members. If you feel you have an affinity with someone, you can send a first message for free.
Subscribing to MatchAffinity
If you choose to carry on the conversation, this is the time to subscribe and enjoy the full benefits of the matchaffinity.com dating service. Now you can send and receive unlimited messages, browse photos of other matchaffinity.com members and get in touch with our expert dating team.
Going the Distance
When British couple Mike and Alanna Clear got married they hoped it would be forever, but soon after their wedding day they discovered that half of all marriages in the UK end in divorce. Wanting to safeguard their own union, they set out on a journey to discover the secret to a lasting relationship.
Mike and Alanna set out on their motorbike and sidecar in January 2011 to travel the length of the UK to find out what keeps British couples together in good times and bad. Discover the secrets they uncovered, see the people they met and watch all the webisodes they filmed along the way at the Going the Distance Facebook page.

We are a member of the Online Dating Association (ODA) which was set up to ensure high standards of behaviour by dating service providers serving the UK. The ODA Code of Practice is binding on members of the Association.
As an ODA Member we are required to have appropriate and effective arrangements in place for dealing with complaints and enquiries.
The ODA provides general information on common enquiries users have about dating services but will not deal directly with individual complaints which are properly the responsibility of member companies. The ODA monitors enquiry and complaint levels and the issues complained about. It can intervene if it sees worrying trends or serious matters of concern.
Further information about ODA can be found here.
