I hope you find someone that
mindlessly strokes your legs and
massages your back and plays with
your hair and I hope that you feel like
You’re home when you look at them.

Anonymous asked:
What's your favorite kind of music?
I love all music. I could never choose a favorite. It all depends on mood. It would be easier to pick what I don’t like. Typically I dislike heavy metal, but like everything there’s exceptions to the rule.

You should take all the messages, love and hate, as a compliment. Always think of it as someone you don't know took the time to send you a note because they were thinking about something you did and its always better to be thought of than forgotten ♡
That’s a wonderful outlook. I will try my hardest.💗
