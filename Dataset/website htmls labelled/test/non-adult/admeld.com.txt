The best of Admeld,
now in DoubleClick Ad Exchange.
Since 2008, Admeld has led the industry in helping premium publishers maximize their ad
revenue and simplify their operations. Admeld pioneered the private ad exchange and
built technology that made it easy for publishers to identify new opportunities and
control how every impression is sold.
Google bought Admeld in 2011 and we’ve worked diligently to build Admeld’s best
features into the DoubleClick
Ad Exchange. Now that we’ve completed the integration, AdX provides publishers a
unique platform that combines robust, publisher-centric tools with a massive, global
pool of demand. When paired with our ad server, DoubleClick for
Publishers (DFP), the benefits of the DoubleClick publisher platform are even more
compelling: it's one platform to maximize yield across your direct and indirect
sales channels, on every format and every device.
With DoubleClick Ad Exchange, you can:
Get full visibility into how buyers are buying (and bidding) on your inventory.
Set granular rules about who can see your inventory, who can buy it, and for how
much.
Tap into demand from every major agency, ad network, and DSP.
Negotiate private deals with select buyers at premium rates.
Connect seamlessly with DFP to optimize your direct and indirect revenues.
Relax, because you’re protected by Google’s global anti-malware infrastructure.

into the Ad Exchange, read
