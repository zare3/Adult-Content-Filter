Misbehavior of a Little
i-want-spankings:
It’s your typical day at work. You’ve already started your day kissing me awake, feeling my skin skim along yours as I stretched and yawned in your arms. We shared a lazy and playful petting session. A tease to start the day. I fed you breakfast, kissed you as you walked out the door, and as far as you knew, I went on to work as you did. Typical.Your morning continued as usual, a text here and there, something silly, something sassy, something mildly sexy.You didn’t realize that your girl had plans for you.
You’re sat at your desk on a phone call with a new client when you hear your secretary outside your door greet me happily, and agree to do so when I ask her to hold your calls.I breeze through your door in my white sundress, not looking your way. Gently shutting the door and locking it behind me, you know something is up. I glance up at you briefly, mischief in my eyes.
Trying to seal the deal with this new client, you hold up a finger to me, signaling me to give you just a moment. I nod and smile, Daddy’s a busy man, I know this.I place my purse  on the edge of your desk and fish a few things out while you focus on your phone call. It’s not unusual for me to poke around your office, as I’m doing now, so you pay me no mind. I’m behind you and you feel my arms circle your torso… hugging you from behind, kissing your neck gently, nuzzling you a bit. A loving cuddle.When I pull back, you hear the sound of a belt buckle and are quickly a bit short of breath. Looking down you notice the tightness in your chest is caused by your favorite belt… which has now effectively bound you to your chair. As you’re still on the phone, I need to move quickly. i take out the cuffs you used on me last night and as much as you try to avoid me cuffing you, you REALLY need this deal to go through. Your split attention works in my corner. I have your free hand cuffed to the armrest of your chair… no longer so free. Easily now, as you need to hold the phone to your ear, i slip another cuff around your only free wrist, the clicking forcing you to explain to your caller that you’ve just dropped something on the floor, but not to worry. i slowly bring your hand away from your ear, the voice in the receiver barely audible now while I succeed at cuffing your wrist to the other armrest. Quick thinking on your part, you hit the speaker button and continue your conversation while glaring at me.
Your glare thrills me. The fire in your eyes. You’re annoyed. Borderline angry. taking advantage of Daddy like this is uncalled for and DEFINITELY against the rules. i push your chair back a bit to make my way between you and your desk. I quickly lift the sundress off my body, shocking your eyes. What was sweet and wholesome in a white sundress is not not so sweet and definitely not wholesome. My large breasts are clad in a black busty bra with red lace and beading. my panties match in a cute V at the junction of my thighs. I sit up on your desk and prop my feet up on your thighs… your call continues with less and less words on your part. I dig around in my bag momentarily and pull out thigh highs. Your favorite thigh highs to be exact.  The ones with the large eyes. Almost as large as the ones about to fall out of your head now.
I’m excited. SO SO excited. I’m in trouble. There’s no doubt about it and theres no going back now. I’ll be punished for this. Hopefully it’s worth the task. Your expression tells me that my hopes will be fulfilled.i Slowly slide each fishnet up starting at my blood red toenails and all the way up my calf, over my knee, up my smooth thigh… the thigh begging for your teeth.
You mumble something gibberish to me at the phone as your eyes eat up my actions hungrily. with both legs wrapped in black floss, your eyes make their way up to mine. The smile on my face is punishable. A very disobedient girl sits in front of you. You shake your head No.. telling me that theres no possible way am i going to go unpunished. As if I didn’t already know.
i lean back and slowly slide my hand down my stomach. My skin the same smooth creamy skin you kissed and sucked while you teased me this morning, gently giving under my fingertips as they make their way into my panties. I watch your jaw tense as your eyes follow my fingers beneath the lacy fabric. My head rolls all the way back, my dark hair tumbling around my almost naked skin, and a soft sigh escapes my lips. You know that sigh well. You’ve taught my body how to make that noise. Within just a moment or two, you can hear my fingers as they find the little honeypot of wetness enclosed in me. You know that spot well too, you’ve taught my body how to be ready before you’ve even touched me. What a good teacher Daddy is…I lose myself for a minute… maybe two, careful not to be too telling with my noises. I’d hate for your client to know what you get up to in your office.I’m so incredibly wet. I have been since your lips touched my throat this morning while I cooked your breakfast. That simple kiss resonated, raised the fine hair on my skin, hardened my covered nipples, made me take a deep cleansing breath, sent a shiver down my body… that shiver nested deep in my groin. A dull buzz that gestated for a few hours until the buzz turned into a tingle, the tingle turned into an ache, and the ache turned into the bright fire that licks at my fingertips as i repeatedly plunged them deep into my audibly wet sex.
“Just a few more things I’d like to discuss with you…” the voice on the speaker. I watched your brow furrow further, your jaw clench and you muttered a reply through your teeth, signaling him to go on.i pull my fingers from my eager body and hold them up for you to see. Glistening in the bright sunlight bouncing around in your office. I hold it close to your mouth, as dirty as you are you open your mouth and try to lean forward for a taste. i smirk and quickly pull them back from you. Another thing i know I’ll accept a  punishment for. Denying Daddy what belongs to him. I bring my fingers to my own lips and slide my tongue between them. Tasting myself for you. You growl this time. Your irritation and anger bubbling a touch.I dismount your desk, and slide my panties down my legs… kicking them to the side. i unhook my bra. My large breasts still covered, but messily so now, never knowing when it’ll fall to the floor or come loose and hang off my elbow. Unsure when it’ll expose their fullness or my nipples to you. i straddle your thighs and have a seat. The bulge in your pants a bit more than noticeable. I lean forward and kiss your lips. My taste washing over your tongue. Like tropical fruits dipped in clean ocean water. The kiss is brief as you need to say something the annoying person on the other end of the line.
I let my bra fall and i toss it to the side. The breasts that you love so much are before you, begging for the rough grip of your hands. Aching for the feel of your teeth digging into them. My nipples beaded in excitement, seeking your fingers to pinch tight and pull to the point of pain.My legs spread over yours, i reach down and touch again. My fingers quickly seeking the little pleasure center just a few inches in. You can tell by the angle of my palm exactly what I’m rubbing. You taught me that place. That special little square inch of absolute fucking joy. My jaw goes slack and my eyelids droop. You can smell my arousal. You can still taste me on your tongue. My breaths start coming louder, more labored. My head rolls more my back arches. My tensing body grinding at nothing except my fingers. on your lap but too far from your aching cock to get any friction. “Touch me, Daddy.” I whisper. Those words arousing you even further.Your client is gabbing away about pricing and billing.You can’t figure out where to look. My face, my eyes that are glued on yours, my writhing torso, my breasts swaying with my movements, my hips as they rock against my hand, or my fingers, dripping wet and buried deep within me. “I need you, Daddy. Please, touch me.” my voice is a shaky whimper.Your fingers flex and you try to hold your composure. Your eyes choose mine. Staring at them. Our connection. You can read exactly where I am and what I’m feeling by staring into my eyes.“Fuck…” i gasp quietly. The bad words only leave my sweet mouth when I start losing my control. Your eyes don’t leave mine but you can hear that my fingering has gotten faster, rougher. I choke back a groan as my head drops back for a second and then snaps back up and my eyes return to yours. “Fuck me, Daddy.” I breathe. “Please, Sir. I need you to fuck me.”You say nothing but through my pleasure clouded eyes I can see the lustful rage in your face. I’m in for it and i know it.“Bend me over.” I whisper. “Bend me over and fuck me. Pull my hair and spank me.” i say less quietly now. A quick grunt from you reminds me to keep quiet.The fire deep inside of me has manifested itself into churning magma, ready to spill over. My minstrations have advanced from rubbing and fingering to a hard and desperate finger fucking.You can feel my legs trembling.“Fuck me harder, Daddy. I need to cum.” my breathy whimpers interrupted by the jerking of my body.I’m holding on for dear life as my orgasm ripens and rides the edge of fruition.“Alright, all sounds good. We’ll chat more over lunch tomorrow.”
***CLICK***
“DON’T YOU FUCKING CUM LITTLE GIRL!” you practically shout as the phone hits the floor. But it’s past the point of control, the point of no return as been breached.My free hand grips the back of your neck as my aching forearm powers my fingers into me relentlessly. I bring a foot up against your shoulder, My entire body tense as my legs tremble hard.All you can do now is watch as my entire body catches fire and the smoke of it rips up my throat into a tense and shaky moan, affected by the involuntary jerks of my body and the strong bucking of my hips triggers my orgasm, a flowing trickle of my orgasm gushing  forth past my fingers as i squirt onto your trousers.The rolling of my hips wring out every last drop of pleasure from me.  I settle slowly and ease my fingers from within me, looking down, i see the mess i’ve made of your work pants…. And then you growl…
“Set. Me. Loose.”
… to be continued.

Misbehavior of a Little pt2
i-want-spankings:
“Set. Me. Loose.”
Those words, enunciated tightly and angrily, send an intense rush from the base of my throat to just below my navel. The feeling so delicious, I gasp quietly and you watch as goosebumps work their way over my lightly flushed skin. The mix of fear, lust, and the uncertainty of what you’ll do once you’re free, bleed into my veins, waking me from my trance. I stare at you. Handsome. Well dressed. Angry as fuck. The thick cloud of my not-so-well-thought-through-attack slowly dissipating. My foolishness evident when i realize i hadn’t thought about UNcuffing you.I weigh my options silently. You watch the emotions pass through my eyes as they’re glued to yours. Your eyes leave mine, studying the gentle yet quick throb of my jugular, my skin as it’s ever so slightly shining with the lightest sheen of perspiration, the muscles of my throat as I swallow hard. Your eyes find their way back to mine, and you see it. Concession. I have NO options. I take a deep cleansing breath, letting it out slowly, ending it with a quiet, “Fuck.”
“Yes.” you whisper. “Fuck.” It would’ve been easier to take if you’d not whispered it. But the whisper shows your control. You’re always in control. In complete control of yourself firstly, and in control of me, an appropriately close second. Your burning eyes and heaving chest do nothing to comfort me. I’m in more danger than I originally thought. It’s genuinely thrilling. The overwhelming aura of terror and carnal animalism filling the air between us. You shake your head at me, as if disappointed. Surely Your girl should know better.Flexing your bound hands, you raise your eyebrows at me.“NOW.” you mouth. The silent command is the most threatening.I squeeze my eyes shut for a millisecond, accepting my fate.
I walk behind you on shaky legs and unfasten the belt holding you to the chair, letting it fall to the floor with a thump and clink. That sound alone reminding me even further that I didn’t think this through. I brought your favorite belt. The one i’ve worn across my ass for days after many a misbehavior. I quickly fish the keys out of my purse and fumble with the cuffs on your wrists. My fingers are clumsy, my hands are shaking, I’m borderline panting. Then you chuckle. FUCK ME that chuckle of yours. I don’t dare look up at you. If I do, my fight-or-flight will kick in, and neither will turn out in my favor.You stand quickly, the backs of your knees pushing your office chair out of range. Your body just mere inches from mine, if we both inhaled in unison, I’m certain my pebbled nipples would graze your crisp white shirt.Standing completely naked before you, my face lowered and to the side, my heart pounding in my chest. Whether it’s fear or passion, I’m not sure. Consternation, maybe. I’ve no clue. My thoughts are no longer logical and lucid.
You let out a deep sigh, your breath tickling the skin on my shoulder and neck, immediately causing my eyelids to flutter and close.You raise your hand to my throat, I don’t see it, but i feel it though you haven’t touched me yet. The familiar heat of your palm near my skin makes me brace for what I know will be a tight neck squeeze. I wait. and wait. it doesn’t come. I wait more. You know my thoughts are racing. You love it. You love building my anticipation. Your finger finally makes contact, just below my ear. I inhale at your warm, sweet touch. But I’m not fooled. I know it won’t remain warm and sweet for long. I was NOT Daddy’s good girl like I should be. I’m only allowed to be Daddy’s BAD girl when Daddy says. You lightly drag your fingertip behind my jawbone, moving downward to rest momentarily on my jugular, physically feeling my anxiety throb beneath your touch. Another dark chuckle creeps from your chest, and already it’s borderline too much for me to handle. My skin literally burns with expectancy. You continue, gently tracing my clavicle. You know this is a major hotspot for your girl. You graze there for a moment or two with the pad of your index finger. I take in a sharp breath when your finger curls and you drag your fingernail hard over my collarbone. We both know in a brief moment i’ll have a pretty pink line on my skin there. You continue, back to just the fingertip, slowly caressing your way down over the rise of flesh of my breast, making your way towards my very hard, achy left nipple. You circle it when you get there, causing me to whimper quietly. I feel a second finger join, knowing it’s your thumb as your circling becomes a gentle pinch and roll.
You’re waiting. You’re making me wait. You know I’m the worlds most impatient girl. Waiting is not my thing.It feels like you’ve gently toyed with my poor nipple for a week now. The skin of my nipple irritated and beginning to hurt. I open my mouth to speak. To beg you to get on with it.  Suddenly you pinch and pull. HARD. I cry out and my eyes shoot up to look at you. The pain evident on my features. My gaped mouth, my creased brow, the tenseness in my eyes. Good. It’s just the tip of the tip of the iceberg you’ve already mapped out. Your grip tightens further, the pink under your thumbnail now white.“Daddy….” I croak, “that hurts a lot.”“Good.”You pull harder, my breast stretched out between us.“I don’t like it, Daddy..” I whine breathlessly.“Then what do you say?” you inquire cooly. “Please, Daddy.. let my nipple go… I’m sorry.”Your free hand quickly wraps around my throat, holding me still as you pull. The searing pain of my bloodless nipple scorches through me as you pull hard enough to let it slip from your evil grasp.With your hand anchored on my throat, you force me to my knees quickly before letting me go.I kneel and stare up at you while you make very quick work of your soaked trousers, dropping them to the floor along with your boxers, your erect flesh bursting towards me.Eager to please, I grasp your swollen cock and lean forward to take you into my mouth. As soon as my lips touch your head, a sharp pain stops me in my tracks. With an incredibly tight fistful of my hair, you yank my mouth away from you. My head craned back and to the side, you swiftly lean over. Your face so close that I can feel the words you speak.“What makes you think you deserve Daddy’s cock? hm? You lashed me to that chair and made me watch while you pleasured yourself. I feel I must return that favor, little girl. You’ll stay there, and you’ll watch.”With that you stand up straight again and with your free hand you wrap your strong fingers around your cock.   Stroking yourself tightly while keeping my hair fisted painfully.  I want it. You know that much. I’ve never once had to tell you how much I love sucking Daddy’s cock. Half of it is pleasuring you, the other half is for the pure enjoyment of feeling your delicate skin passing through my saliva painted lips, your fragrance in my lungs, the flavor of you on my tongue. But I’ll receive none of that. We both know that now. The only thing I’ll receive is the torture of watching you masturbate, up close, personal, within reach but forbidden.I watch rapt, captivated, hungry for you.Although I’ve just come, the ache in my pussy is back. Watching your fist pump up and down your incredibly hard shaft makes me absolutely needy. Your low groan of pleasure is a well trained moisture trigger. My body not much different from Pavlov’s dogs. Trained. Conditioned. A slave to your works.My eyes are glued to the movement of your smooth skin as it moves like thick silk over glass. Veiny glass. I want you in my mouth. Better yet, I want you completely hidden inside of my rich pink folds.“Eyes up here, Princess.” Your voice cuts through my enraptured  gaze. Reluctantly my eyes make their way up your manly torso, enjoying momentarily the pull and flex of the muscles in your abdomen as your hips push into your fist.  I’m going completely insane. Want written all over my remorseful face.I keep my eyes on yours, watching your hand in my periphery. GODDAMNIT thats sexy. I can feel the wetness building each time I sift slightly on my knees. I’m desperate to clench my thighs together and rock my hips. I know that would be incredibly stupid. After what seems like an eternity of my own personal hell, I see it. The tension in your jaw, the lines tighten around your eyes. The grumble in your chest. I’m curious, as always, about where you’re going to put it. You know I don’t like facials, but I know its not my decision, and even I need to openly admit that I deserve something I find unpleasant. “Open your mouth.” you growl. Oh thank god. You watch me relax before you.I have another thing coming.  You tilt my head back further, my silky dark hair tight in your fist. My tongue slightly out, waiting to accept your mark. You rest the tip of your cock at the end of my tongue.“Suck me.” you instruct through your teeth. “Make Daddy cum.”I don’t miss a beat. My lips quickly closing around your head and I suck fervently. Tonguing your tip, your sweet spot under it…bobbing as best I can with my hair still fisted. Your eyes break from mine as your head tilts back. The hand you were using on your cock makes its way around to the back of my neck. Within moments you’ve pulled me down, your cock bashes the back of my throat, causing me to gag. You pull out and do it again, enjoying the sound and feeling of me gag on you, this time holding me down, pulling. You know your girl can take it all. Gagging and choking, I try not to pull off of you. That would only get me into more trouble. My eyes water and start to spill over with each aching blink. You pull back slightly, allowing for breath.  The moment of ease passes too quickly as you pull me back down. This time you put your hips into it and don’t stop. I turn my head back and forth as if saying no. But you know better. You know I’m not saying no. Your girl is trying to get you all the way down. Rubbing past my tonsils, into the opening of my throat, trying to cram you in. To my surprise, as soon as your balls touch my chin, they’re gone, and then i realize what’s about to happen. You pull out  a few inches then slam it back into my throat. The gagging continues and gets worse as you fuck my mouth repeatedly. the thick saliva making its way over my lips as it coats your cock and starts to drip down your balls. Very well lubricated, your cock makes easy work of my gagging throat. My garbling and coughing around you is music to your ears. I don’t fight it, I know Daddy loves that sound.Your grip on my hair readjusts to my bangs, keeping my head tipped back you pull yourself from my throat and stroke  hard and fast. You love seeing me there, on my knees with my mouth open and tongue out. Waiting patiently with my make up smeared, eyeliner runny, mascara destroyed. I watch your body tighten and then rope after rope of your warm seed splashes across my lips, tongue, and just a bit over my cheek. I wait as you finish. Panting and rubbing out every last tremble of your orgasm.You watch me for a moment, cum painted and makeup streaked.With a quick nod, I’m given the okay to swallow. Licking my lips and collecting your sticky ropes with my tongue, swallowing them with enthusiasm. Eagerness to be forgiven. But knowing you the way I do, I know this is far from over. You reach down and scoop up a stray strand of cum with your thumb and slip it into my mouth. My tongue quickly finding it, making a meal of having your thumb in my mouth. My fingers come up and clasp your hand, holding your digit between my lips.Your strong fingers grip my jaw, firmly yet gently pulling me up to standing. Slowly pulling your thumb from the suction of my mouth, you reach into your desk drawer and pull out something small and black, a light metallic sound touches my ears, and immediately I worry. “Eyes on mine.” you whisper. Your whispers are the gentlest sound I’ve ever come across. It makes the sweetest of birdsongs sound like a drunk at a karaoke bar. But so misleading it is, for although gentle, it can be many other things. Delicious and nectarous, seductive, artful, mischievous,  and like it is right now, menacing and perilous.I’ve just swallowed your cum, and now comes the unpleasant to offset the pleasant. Always guessing. You love me guessing. Your eyes don’t leave mine, but your hands are busy with something. Fidgeting with something, I can hear metal touching metal, is it aluminum? I can’t tell. I’m tempted to look, the entertainment in your eyes tells me that you know exactly how curious I am. Ever so slightly shaking your head. If I look away from your eyes, retribution will be had. I feel your fingertips rub teasing circles around my areolae, bringing my nipples to point. I exhale in a quiet rush out of my already parted lips. The pleasure around my left nipple evaporating immediately as cold, tight pain takes over. It takes every ounce in me to not look down. “What..?” I pant, unable to communicate effectively. the pain is intense. “Shh.”  Your hushing isn’t soothing. It’s a short warning. Don’t question Daddy. I nod silently, doing what i can to keep my eyes on yours. I brace myself as my right nipple gets the same treatment. I ball my fists… trying to take my mind off the pain my nipples are enduring. “Elbows on my desk. DO NOT look at your breasts.”  Keeping my gaze straight, I 180 and drop my elbows to your desk, palms flat to the worktop and knees parted to shoulder width just as you’ve trained me. You press the button for your intercom to your secretary, asking her in such a casual manner to fetch a new toner cartridge from the storage in the basement. Fuck. I’m going to get belted. I’m half excited, half scared. Sometimes I think the two emotions have the exact same reaction in me. Quickened breathing and heart rate, a shiver that runs deep in my core, the hair on my neck (and sometimes whole body) stands on end, I chew my poor lip, and inevitably, whether i want to or not, I get slick between my thighs. The pleasure I feel from my curled excitement battles the pain radiating from my nipples. the cold metal has been warmed by my skin, though now that they’re trapped between my heavy breasts and the desktop, they hurt even more. What did you put on them? how could you have so sagely kept a torturous implement in your desk? why would you need them HERE? this is the first time I’ve done something like this here. So inappropriate. I regret it, for the most part, but I don’t. You and I both know that I love being your good girl only a little more than I love being your bad girl. You said so yourself, “Defiant enough to keep it interesting, submissive enough to make it worth it.”You bend over and pick up your belt.. your favorite belt. No, you don’t wear it. I do. Across my ass. As often as necessary. You like its weight, its width, length, and texture. You like that its well broken in. Worn, used, not quite threadbare, but nowhere near new. I hear the buckle of it clink, and instantly I groan. “Are you afraid?” you say softly. Almost tenderly.“No, Sir.” I breathe my reply. The pain in my nipples together with the mind-numbing anticipation of your belt robbing me of oxygen.“Good.” you say softly. “You’ve brought my favorite belt. I think you’ve done it on purpose, and I cannot resist.  I’m going to spank you. Do you have any questions?” “No, Sir.” I breathe again.I hear the surprise in your silence.“Really? No excuses or “But Daddy”’s?“ you nearly tease. I relax a bit. “No, Daddy.” I close my eyes and wait.“Count.”With that simple word, the lashings commenced. Over the next 2 minutes, you allowed me to endure 20 strikes with you on my left, over handed throws, and then 20 from my right, backhanded throws. Each bringing a breathy number, a moan, a whimper, a yelp, a scream. You enjoyed each one, all while watching my smooth, light skin flush in thick lines to a rosy, raised pink. You threw, I took. The sensation, absolutely overwhelming. Each strike landed a fresh burning sting. A deep prickly pain, pirouetting on the border of the lands of too much and just enough, unsure where the other foot would land. Too much? just enough? My ass on absolute fire. The type that sizzles like hot oil poured over my skin, and then against gravity, travels up my spine, to the back of my neck and then seats its fiery fist around my throat.The count ended at 46. I have a habit of giggling when I’m scared, or when I’m in pain. On 40, I made the mistake of giggling.  Earning myself 3 more per angle. You’re not to be giggled at, deliberate or not.My entire body was enveloped in heat. Throbbing, blaring heat, as if I wore conflagration as underwear. The belt clanged a bit as it dropped to the floor and your hands gripped my upper arms, pulling me to stand and turning me to face you. Your hands move to my breasts.“Don’t scream, baby.”With that warning my nipples are released and the sharpest pain sears through them. A blowtorch to my sensitive skin. I seal my lips together and bite both at once, wincing and whimpering through the pain. This pain intensifies absolutely everything. My entire body trembles hard just once as the agony rips through me. My eyes clenched shut as I will it to end. As much as I want it to dissipate, it just rolls around from nerve ending to nerve ending, singing like the climax of an opera through every inch of my body then rolling back to my nipples with a deep throb. “Ouch…” I whimper with tears in my blinking eyes.Your eyes bathe mine for a moment before you cradle me sweetly and hold me, stroking my messy hair and down my back. A knock at the door ended our moment of warmth. You guide me to the en suite restroom, tell me to clean myself up and come out within 3 minutes.Cleaning up the smeared makeup and bled mascara, I hear you exchanging pleasantries with your secretary, and briefly telling her that you’re going to wrap up early today and she can go home after she sends out the contract to the client you’ve just landed.I come out and find my dress draped nicely over the back of your chair and wonder if she noticed that the dress I wore in was absent of its wearer.  I glance at your desk, two medium sized binder clips lay innocently on the worktop. Huh… interesting.“Next time i’ll link them together with a chain of paper clips and i’ll pull at them while I cum on those pretty lips of yours.”You stand and take my dress and pull it over my hands and arms, then pull my hair out from inside of it, all while smiling sweetly at me. “Even?” I ask, matching your smile.To my surprise, you shake your head slowly, your smile not shifting.“Not even close baby.” You say darkly. “You’re going to go home, FETCH ME SOME CLEAN TROUSERS, and you’re going to bring the kit. Be back in 30 minutes.”
